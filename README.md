### Hackaburg 2024: SMSshield

#### Pitch

**Introduction:**
Imagine a world where every incoming message is safe, and every scam is instantly recognized. Welcome to **SMSshield**, the app that not only simplifies communication but makes it secure. In line with the hackathon's theme, "Connect the Unconnected," we aim to reduce security barriers for seniors and children, protecting them from common scams.

**Innovation:**

**SMSshield** effectively addresses the problem of SMS scams. It enables users to communicate safely, ensuring they don't have to worry about their loved ones falling victim to fraud. With features like forwarding dangerous messages to emergency contacts, the app provides additional security for children and seniors.

**Technical Details:**
- Developed as an Android app in Kotlin.
- Uses Levenshtein distance to flag dangerous SMS.
- Integration of Python and ONNX for machine learning.
- Utilizes Firebase for backend services.

### Next Steps

1. **Multi-Language Support:**
   - **SMSshield** will be available in multiple languages to reach a broader user base and lower barriers for non-English speakers.

2. **Machine Learning Instead of Levenshtein:**
